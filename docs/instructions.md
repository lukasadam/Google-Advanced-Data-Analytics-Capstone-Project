# **Capstone Project: Data-Driven Strategy for Increasing Employee Retention at Salifort Motors**

## Scenario 

```
You are a data professional working for Salifort Motors. 

Currently, there is a high rate of turnover among Salifort employees. (Note: In this context, turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go). Salifort‚Äôs senior leadership team is concerned about how many employees are leaving the company. Salifort strives to create a corporate culture that supports employee success and professional development. Further, the high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. Salifort makes a big investment in recruiting, training, and upskilling its employees. 

If Salifort could predict whether an employee will leave the company, and discover the reasons behind their departure, they could better understand the problem and develop a solution. 

As a first step, the leadership team asks Human Resources to survey a sample of employees to learn more about what might be driving turnover.  

Next, the leadership team asks you to analyze the survey data and come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they suggest you design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their job title, department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other relevant data points. A good model will help the company increase retention and job satisfaction for current employees, and save money and time training new employees. 

As a specialist in data analysis, the leadership team leaves it up to you to choose an approach for building the most effective model to predict employee departure. For example, you could build and evaluate a statistical model such as logistic regression. Or, you could build and evaluate machine learning models such as decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. Or, you could choose to deploy both statistical and machine learning models. 

For any approach, you‚Äôll need to analyze the key factors driving employee turnover, build an effective model, and share recommendations for next steps with the leadership team.

## Structure

This capstone project should follows the **PACE framework**‚Äî**Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute**‚Äîto guide the development of a predictive model and strategic insights for the HR department at Salifort Motors.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

Create a predictive model using HR data to identify employees at risk of leaving the company and propose evidence-based strategies to improve retention. Deliverables include:
- A **one-page executive summary** for business stakeholders.
- A **code notebook** documenting your analysis, model development, and ethical considerations.

---

## üß≠ Plan

- **Understand the business context**: High employee turnover is costly; HR needs data-driven insights to reduce attrition.
- **Define stakeholders**: HR department, department heads, executive leadership.
- **Formulate the key question**: What makes an employee likely to leave Salifort Motors?
- **Determine deliverables**: Predictive model, interpretation of results, visualizations, actionable recommendations.

Reflective prompts:
- What‚Äôs the central business need?
- What success metrics will indicate impact?
- What are the ethical implications (e.g., bias in promotions/salary)?

---

## üìä Analyze

- **Explore the dataset** of ~15,000 employee records with 10 HR-related features.
- **Key variables** include satisfaction level, performance evaluation, tenure, salary, promotion history, and departmental information.
- Perform EDA to identify patterns differentiating stayers vs. leavers.
- Identify potential data quality issues or bias risks.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Construct

- **Build a predictive model** (choose either logistic regression or a machine learning model).
- **Evaluate model performance** (e.g., AUC, recall).
- **Interpret outputs** (e.g., SHAP values or feature importance).
- **Visualize insights** with charts directly related to employee attrition.
- Document ethical considerations in modeling decisions.

---

## üöÄ Execute

- Finalize deliverables:
  - **Executive summary** tailored for non-technical stakeholders.
  - **Notebook** with code, analysis, visualizations, and resources used.
- Recommend next steps for deploying retention strategies based on model results.
- Submit both artifacts.

---

## üìö Reference Data

- **Data source**: [Kaggle HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)
- No download required; data is embedded in the lab environment.

---

## ‚úÖ Ethical Considerations

- Mitigate bias in predictions (e.g., fairness across departments/salary levels).
- Ensure transparency and explainability in modeling.
- Avoid using sensitive or legally protected features.

This summary aligns with PACE milestones and provides structure to manage the capstone effectively from planning to delivery.
