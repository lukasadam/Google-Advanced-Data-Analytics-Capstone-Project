# Project Brief: Capstone Summary for PACE Stages  

## **Capstone Project: Data-Driven Strategy for Increasing Employee Retention at Salifort Motors**

This capstone project follows the **PACE framework**—**Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute**—to guide the development of a predictive model and strategic insights for the HR department at Salifort Motors.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Create a predictive model using HR data to identify employees at risk of leaving the company and propose evidence-based strategies to improve retention. Deliverables include:
- A **one-page executive summary** for business stakeholders.
- A **code notebook** documenting your analysis, model development, and ethical considerations.

---

## 🧭 Plan

- **Understand the business context**: High employee turnover is costly; HR needs data-driven insights to reduce attrition.
- **Define stakeholders**: HR department, department heads, executive leadership.
- **Formulate the key question**: What makes an employee likely to leave Salifort Motors?
- **Determine deliverables**: Predictive model, interpretation of results, visualizations, actionable recommendations.

Reflective prompts:
- What’s the central business need?
- What success metrics will indicate impact?
- What are the ethical implications (e.g., bias in promotions/salary)?

---

## 📊 Analyze

- **Explore the dataset** of ~15,000 employee records with 10 HR-related features.
- **Key variables** include satisfaction level, performance evaluation, tenure, salary, promotion history, and departmental information.
- Perform EDA to identify patterns differentiating stayers vs. leavers.
- Identify potential data quality issues or bias risks.

---

## 🏗️ Construct

- **Build a predictive model** (choose either logistic regression or a machine learning model).
- **Evaluate model performance** (e.g., AUC, recall).
- **Interpret outputs** (e.g., SHAP values or feature importance).
- **Visualize insights** with charts directly related to employee attrition.
- Document ethical considerations in modeling decisions.

---

## 🚀 Execute

- Finalize deliverables:
  - **Executive summary** tailored for non-technical stakeholders.
  - **Notebook** with code, analysis, visualizations, and resources used.
- Recommend next steps for deploying retention strategies based on model results.
- Submit both artifacts.

---

## 📚 Reference Data

- **Data source**: [Kaggle HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv)
- No download required; data is embedded in the lab environment.

---

## ✅ Ethical Considerations

- Mitigate bias in predictions (e.g., fairness across departments/salary levels).
- Ensure transparency and explainability in modeling.
- Avoid using sensitive or legally protected features.
