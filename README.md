## **Capstone project: Data-Driven Strategy for Increasing Employee Retention at Salifort Motors**

### üìà Objective

This capstone project is an opportunity for you to analyze a dataset and build predictive models that can provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

Upon completion, you will have two artifacts that you would be able to present to future employers. One is a brief one-page summary of this project that you would present to external stakeholders as the data professional in Salifort Motors. The other is a complete code notebook provided here. Please consider your prior course work and select one way to achieve this given project question. Either use a regression model or machine learning model to predict whether or not an employee will leave the company. The exemplar following this actiivty shows both approaches, but you only need to do one.

In your deliverables, you will include the model evaluation (and interpretation if applicable), a data visualization(s) of your choice that is directly related to the question you ask, ethical considerations, and the resources you used to troubleshoot and find answers or solutions.

### Understand the business scenario and problem

The HR department at Salifort Motors wants to take some initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. They collected data from employees, but now they don‚Äôt know what to do with it. They refer to you as a data analytics professional and ask you to provide data-driven suggestions based on your understanding of the data. They have the following question: what‚Äôs likely to make the employee leave the company?

Your goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

If you can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

### Familiarize yourself with the HR dataset

The dataset that you'll be using in this lab contains 15,000 rows and 10 columns for the variables listed below. 

**Note:** you don't need to download any data to complete this lab. For more information about the data, refer to its source on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv).

Variable  |Description |
-----|-----|
satisfaction_level|Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0&ndash;1]|
last_evaluation|Score of employee's last performance review [0&ndash;1]|
number_project|Number of projects employee contributes to|
average_monthly_hours|Average number of hours employee worked per month|
time_spend_company|How long the employee has been with the company (years)
Work_accident|Whether or not the employee experienced an accident while at work
left|Whether or not the employee left the company
promotion_last_5years|Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years
Department|The employee's department
salary|The employee's salary (U.S. dollars)

### Reflect on these questions as you complete the plan stage.

*  Who are your stakeholders for this project?
- What are you trying to solve or accomplish?
- What are your initial observations when you explore the data?
- What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage? (Make sure to include the links.)
- Do you have any ethical considerations in this stage?

## Highlights

### Advanced Modeling: Ensemble Classifier with Bayesian Optimization

In addition to standard machine learning techniques, I took the model development a step further by training an ensemble classifier using Bayesian optimization. This process led to outstanding performance improvements, optimizing hyperparameters to find the best possible model configuration.

### Key Highlights:
- Used ensemble methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to improve model accuracy.
- Applied Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, which significantly enhanced the model's performance compared to baseline methods.
- Achieved high precision in predicting employee attrition, enabling more accurate and reliable insights.

### Actionable Insights for Employee Retention
After training and evaluating the model, I transformed the findings into a comprehensive presentation with actionable insights that can guide HR strategies at Salifort Motors. These insights include:

Factors influencing turnover: Disengagement, burnout, compensation gaps, and stalled advancement.

Key performance indicators: The predictive model highlighted critical factors such as satisfaction levels, time spent in the company, and promotion history that strongly influence employee attrition.

The findings and visualizations were structured to provide the HR department with clear recommendations / action items for improving employee satisfaction and reducing turnover, such as:
- Establishing clearer criteria for performance-based raises and promotions to foster a more dynamic and responsive company culture.
- Launching awareness campaigns (focused on mental health and burnout) to better balance workloads and alleviate stress.

Additionally, the analysis highlights the importance of identifying factors contributing to high job satisfaction and addressing areas of dissatisfaction, such as:
- Identifying key drivers of job dissatisfaction, potentially through employee surveys, and launching engagement campaigns focused on recognition and inclusion.
